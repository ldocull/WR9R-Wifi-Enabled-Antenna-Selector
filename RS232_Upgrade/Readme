This upgrade allows the antenna selector to also directly monitor the K3.. allows for better responsiveness 
with band changes (does not have to rely on wifi). So, when running stuff like VarAC, no additional apps are requred for
monitoring and controlling the switch wirelessly. (Set the manual switch to position 5 to enable this function. 
Otherwise, everything is the same.)
